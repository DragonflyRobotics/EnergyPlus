   ** Warning ** Output:PreprocessorMessage="GroundTempCalc - Slab" has the following Warning condition:
   **   ~~~   ** Slab thickness [0.100 m] reset to 0.123 m  for computational stability.
   ** Warning ** Timestep: Requested number (12) cannot be used when Conduction Finite Difference algorithm is selected.
   **   ~~~   ** ...Timestep is set to 20.

   **   ~~~   ** ..Weather File Location=San Francisco Intl Ap CA USA TMY3 WMO#=724940
   **   ~~~   ** ..due to location differences, Latitude difference=[4.17] degrees, Longitude difference=[10.42] degrees.

   ** Warning ** ProcessScheduleInput: Schedule:Compact="TWOSEASONSCHEDULE", Schedule Type Limits Name="NUMBER" not found -- will not be validated
   ** Warning ** WindowShadingControl: Interior shade or blind: Potential problem in match of unshaded/shaded constructions, shaded should have 1 more layers than unshaded.
   **   ~~~   ** Unshaded construction=EXTERIOR WINDOW
   **   ~~~   ** Shaded construction=WINDOW_W_BLINDS
   **   ~~~   ** If preceding two constructions are same name, you have likely specified a WindowShadingControl (Field #3) with the Window Construction rather than a shaded construction.
   ** Severe  **  The glass and gas layers in the shaded and unshaded constructions do not match for window=WINDOW_LDF_1.UNIT1
   **   ~~~   ** Unshaded construction=EXTERIOR WINDOW
   **   ~~~   ** Shaded construction=WINDOW_W_BLINDS
   **  Fatal  ** GetSurfaceData: Errors discovered, program terminates.
   ...Summary of Errors that led to program termination:
   ..... Reference severe error count=1
   ..... Last severe error= The glass and gas layers in the shaded and unshaded constructions do not match for window=WINDOW_LDF_1.UNIT1
   ************* Warning:  Node connection errors not checked - most system input has not been read (see previous warning).
   ************* Fatal error -- final processing.  Program exited before simulations began.  See previous error messages.
   ************* EnergyPlus Warmup Error Summary. During Warmup: 0 Warning; 0 Severe Errors.
   ************* EnergyPlus Sizing Error Summary. During Sizing: 3 Warning; 1 Severe Errors.
   ************* EnergyPlus Terminated--Fatal Error Detected. 5 Warning; 1 Severe Errors; Elapsed Time=00hr 00min  2.25sec
